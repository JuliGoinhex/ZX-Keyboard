ZX-Keyboard - Hardware
======================

An Arduino based project to convert a broken ZX Spectrum computer in to a USB keyboard.

This is where we store hardware related documents and diagrams.

The main circuite diagram is produced in fritzing ( http://fritzing.org/download/ ) and exported to PDF.
