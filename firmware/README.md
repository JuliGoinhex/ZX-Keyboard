ZX-Keyboard - Hardware
======================

An Arduino based project to convert a broken ZX Spectrum computer in to a USB keyboard.

This is where we store the Arduino sketch for the firmware.

Please note that the VUSB may not compile with the Arduino IDE 1.6 or later. It will compile with 1.0.5.

Please feel free to improve it.
